### Practices
#### Chapter 3
Solve the three programming puzzles in page#41 and #42
<br /><br />

#### Chapter 6
Solve the four programming puzzles in page#78, 79 and 80.
<br /><br />

#### FizzBuzz
Print from 1 to 100, but replace multiples of 3 with "Fizz" and multiples of 5 with "Buzz" and multiples of both with "FizzBuzz".
<br /><br />

#### Data compression
Data compression is used everywhere. Video encoding, audio encoding, image files and zip files are all using data compression algorithms. Let's write our own. Write a program that compresses a string and say the compressed string.

Examples: If the substring is a sequence of 3 'a'("aaa"), it will be represented as "a3".

Example: "abcaaabbb" -> print "abca3b3"

Example: "abcd" -> print "abcd"

Example: "aaabaaaa" -> print "a3ba4"

Example: "ab" -> print "ab"

Example: "aaabbbcd" -> print "a3b3cd"
